This project covers the very important aspect of the people who are living in the government appartments or residencies. The people face the problem in the society(The building) like cleaning, water supply, who is comming , who rents the flat, who is the owner..lot. and other problems which are to be discussed with the officials (The problems which secretary couldn't solve). Here comes the HBMS, a digital platform which connects the people(living in the flats) with government so that they can tell what is going on. This project includes not only one society but all government residencies. A website which will be standing on the pillars of the languages like HTML, CSS, JS, BOOTSTRAP, and a little backend i guess.
